Hi Friends!

### This is a project given under Udacity Android Developer NanoDegree's Program.

#### Who is this Repo for?
If you are an Android Developer and have read about JSON and JSON Parsing in Android _(Without using any libraries)_, but wanna practice and understand this concept,then this GitHub Repo is for you.

#### What I have done in this Project?
I was provided a JSON File as a String and I needed to parse that JSON file and show the information using an understandable UI. For this, I have parsed the JSON, extracted the information, and implemented and shown it to the user using an ExpandableListView.
